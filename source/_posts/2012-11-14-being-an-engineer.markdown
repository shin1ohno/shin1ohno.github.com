I've been working as an engineer at cookpad for few month.

*yes an engineer. some of you may be surprised. I write codes every day*

here's what I learned

- simple: remove function and change your business process. don't implement new functions without removing exsting one. don't solve problem with new functions. adding many functions or changing uis  makes your product confusing in many case
- be trackable: always be trackable. most of us don't have excellent sense for build product like steve jobs. track everything and keep making your product better. don't discuss without/before tracking. that's waste of your time.
- just plan-ship-track: don't waste your time. just ship and see what people do or say. but have some time for planning before implement something. that makes your product simpler and trackable

these are very basic things that I said to my staff many times as an manager. but I know I don't understand single one of them now. writing code and shipping product makes things clear.

really fun to me.

anyway, always think of these 3 things above and change the way you use your time.
