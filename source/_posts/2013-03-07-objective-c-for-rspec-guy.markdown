RSpec helps me a lot when coding ruby. so, I want a BDD environment like RSpec for Objective-C, too.

I'm now trying Cedar made by Pivotal Labs a creator of Jasmine.

here's first few commands to introduce Cedar.

```
git clone git://github.com/pivotal/cedar.git
cd cedar
./installCodeSnippetsAndTemplates
```

as prompted, restart Xcode and you are ready to use new code snippets and templates. the templates are available under the Cedar section in XCode new file wizard.

OK, let's start creating Objective-C app.
