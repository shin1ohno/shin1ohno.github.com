got new frame 'look 695 SR'. yay !

- pros
  - very very stiff and respond well
  - comfortable: fits very well and absorbs road noise
  - light enough: 6.4kg with pedal and water bottle
- cons
  - crank is very stiff and light but cause gear noise when change gears to outer-low position
  - crank arm can't be no shorter than 170mm
  - long head tube

great frame to ride, great frame to stare...
