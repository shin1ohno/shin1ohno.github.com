i'm looking for a new bycicle frame.

- what i want:
  - head tube is no longer than 120mm
  - looks nice in smallest size, like 47/48cm
  - weights no more than 1kg

- look
  - 695: proprietary chain sets and tall head tube sucks
  - 595: looking good but a little bit old
  - 586: looking good but 595 looks better
- cervelo
  - R5: hmm... 48cm frame looks ugry
  - S5: rides very well but 48cm frame looks ugry
  - R3sl: no stock
  - S3: no stock
- cannondale
  - super six evo: super light and rides very well, but very high price point
- bmc
  - tmr01: delivery starts next year
  - slr01: hmm...
